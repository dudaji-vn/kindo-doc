# Scoce of Lessons & Courses

The Score system is a feature that encourages learners to review previously completed lessons. This allows you to re-engage with the material and earn a higher score, which reflects your improved understanding.

- **Course's score:** The total score of every lesson in this course.
- **Lesson's score:** The total score of every question in this lesson.

## How to score a question?

- **Basic Score:** With every completed question (giving the right answer) your will earn **100 score**.
- **Time Bonus Score:** You have 10 seconds to answer each question. The faster you answer, the more bonus points you'll receive based on your remaining time. **1 remaining second** = **10 score**.

Kindo saves your highest Score each time you review a lesson. This ensures your progress is always tracked by your best performance.
